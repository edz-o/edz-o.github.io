### About me
I'm currently an undergraduate student in the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University.

### Research
* My research interests lie in the field of Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Computer Graphics.
* My current research focuses include: 1) stereo vision using semantic information, 2) virtual scene construction with rich ground truth for computer vision, and 3) transferable learning between virtual and real environments.
